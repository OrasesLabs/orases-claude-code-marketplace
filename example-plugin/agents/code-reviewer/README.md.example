# Code Reviewer Agent

A specialized subagent for performing comprehensive code reviews.

## Overview

The Code Reviewer agent provides thorough, actionable code reviews focusing on:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance optimization
- Best practices adherence

## Usage

### Via Task Tool

The agent is automatically available when invoked via the Task tool:

```
"Review the authentication module"
"Check src/api for security issues"
"Analyze the performance of database queries in models.py"
```

### Direct Invocation

In conversations with Claude Code:

```
User: "Please review my authentication code in src/auth/login.py"
Claude: [Invokes code-reviewer agent via Task tool]
```

## Review Scope

### What Gets Reviewed

- **Code Structure:** Architecture, design patterns, organization
- **Implementation:** Logic, algorithms, error handling
- **Security:** Vulnerabilities, input validation, authentication
- **Performance:** Bottlenecks, resource usage, optimization
- **Quality:** Readability, maintainability, documentation

### Severity Levels

- **Critical:** Must fix before merge (security, data loss)
- **High:** Should fix before merge (performance, error handling)
- **Medium:** Consider fixing (quality, documentation)
- **Low:** Nice to have (style, optimizations)

## Example Output

```markdown
# Code Review Summary

**Overall Assessment:** Good implementation with minor security concerns
**Recommendation:** Request Changes

## Critical Issues
1. Line 45: SQL injection vulnerability in user query
   - Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation

## High Priority Issues
1. Line 78: Missing error handling for database connection
   - Wrap in try-catch block with proper error logging

## Medium Priority Issues
1. Line 12-30: Function is too long (18 lines)
   - Consider breaking into smaller functions

## Positive Highlights
- Excellent test coverage (95%)
- Clear naming conventions
- Good documentation
```

## Configuration

The agent uses these allowed tools:
- **Read:** Examine source files
- **Grep:** Search for patterns
- **Glob:** Find related files
- **TodoWrite:** Track review findings

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Context:** Specify which files or areas to review
2. **Set Scope:** Mention if focusing on specific aspects (security, performance)
3. **Iterate:** Use feedback to improve and re-review
4. **Learn:** Review feedback helps improve coding skills

## Integration

Works seamlessly with:
- Pull request workflows
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD pipelines
- Code quality tools
